\noindent \textbf{NSF Proposal RAPID: Assessing the impact of Harrassment and other Negative Events on Inclusion of Undergraduate Students in STEM, \$$200,000$}. This RAPID supports the collection of year two data for this study. Due to the expected time to fund the proposed work, there will be no overlap in data collection, as the current proposal will fund data collection for years three and four, as well as analysis work, while the RAPID was only for year two. Since the RAPID has just been approved, no work has been done on it yet and there are no publications. \jen{say anything about the difference in focus }
